1. Jenkins Nodes and Agents

Jenkins uses a Master–Agent (Master–Slave) architecture to manage and execute CI/CD jobs efficiently. 
In this architecture, the Jenkins Master acts as the central control unit, while Jenkins Agents (also 
called Nodes) perform the actual job execution.

The Jenkins Master (Controller) is the main server that handles user requests coming from the Jenkins 
UI, CLI, or API. It manages job configurations, pipelines, plugins, credentials, and schedules jobs. 
The master decides which job should run on which agent based on labels and availability. Usually, the 
master does not execute heavy build tasks.

Jenkins Agents (Nodes) are worker machines connected to the Jenkins Master. These agents are responsible 
for executing build, test, and deployment jobs assigned by the master. Agents help distribute the workload, 
allow parallel job execution, and provide isolated environments for different tasks.

Agents can be assigned labels such as dev, test, and prod. Labels are used to control where a job runs. 
For example, development jobs can run on dev agents, testing jobs on test agents, and production jobs on
prod agents.

Workflow of Master–Agent Architecture:

The user triggers a job from Jenkins. The Jenkins Master receives the request and schedules the job. 
Based on the job configuration and labels, the master selects an appropriate agent. The selected agent 
executes the job and sends the build results back to the master.

* User sends commands to Jenkins Master.
* Jenkins Master is connected to three worker nodes.
* Worker Node 1 is labeled dev.
* Worker Node 2 is labeled test.
* Worker Node 3 is labeled prod.

2. Advantages of Jenkins Nodes and Agents:

* Jobs can run in parallel, reducing build time.
* Workload is distributed, preventing master overload.
* Supports multiple environments like dev, test, and prod.
* Easy to scale by adding more agents.
* Jenkins master can be rebooted or upgraded without affecting running jobs on agent nodes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
Jenkins Master manages and schedules jobs, while agents execute them. Using multiple labeled agents 
improves scalability, performance, stability, and maintenance flexibility in CI/CD pipelines.
