                                 RBAC in Jenkins (Role-Based Access Control)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it is:
RBAC is a way to control who can do what in Jenkins. Instead of giving everyone full access, 
you create roles with specific permissions and assign them to users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why it’s important:
It improves security and makes sure people only access what they need. For example, developers 
can run jobs but not change system settings, while admins can manage everything.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin Requirement:

* Plugin Name: Role Strategy Plugin
* Purpose: Allows you to create roles (like admin, developer, viewer), assign permissions to these roles, and then 
  assign roles to users or groups.

* How to install:
  Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available
  Search for Role Strategy Plugin
  Click Install without restart (or restart if needed)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Real-life example:

1. Install Role Strategy Plugin
   Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available → Role Strategy Plugin → Install

2. Create Roles
   Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles → Manage Roles
   Example roles:
                admin → Full access
                developer → Can build jobs but not delete them
                viewer → Can only view jobs

3. Create Users
   Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Users → Create User
   Example users: Bhavesh, Ayush, Arpit

4. Assign Roles to Users
   Go to Manage and Assign Roles → Assign Roles
   Assign roles to users:
                        Bhavesh → admin
                        Ayush → developer
                        Arpit → viewer

Now:
* Bhavesh can configure Jenkins and manage jobs
* Ayush can run jobs and see build results
* Aepit can only view job status

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:

RBAC lets you control who can do what in Jenkins by creating roles and assigning them to users based on their responsibilities.
