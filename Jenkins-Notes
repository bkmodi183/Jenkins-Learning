Lecture 1

1. What is Jenkins? Does Jenkins require a dedicated server? Can we call a Jenkins server the master server because it builds jobs and assigns them to multiple other servers configured as agents?
2. Explain the Jenkins flow diagram demonstrated during the session.
3. What is a Jenkins Job?
4. What is the difference between Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CD)?
5. Deliver the Todo-App project using a Jenkins job for Continuous Delivery. Explain why Docker Compose is useful (using docker-compose down and then docker-compose up). Also configure email notifications to receive alerts for every unstable build.
6. Deliver the Todo-App project using Continuous Deployment (CD).
7. Both the above projects were implemented using Jenkins Freestyle jobs.
8. Provide an overview of Jenkins Pipelines.

Lecture 2
1. Create a Declarative Pipeline with the following stages: code, build, push, test, deploy.
2. Explain how code, build, and test belong to Continuous Integration (CI), and push and deploy belong to Continuous Deployment (CD), together forming 
   a complete CI/CD pipeline.
3. The number of stages in a pipeline depends on the DevOps engineer. Each stage has significance. For example, if the build stage encounters an issue, 
   the Groovy script will not proceed to the next stage until the issue is fixed.
4. Explain how CI/CD Declarative Pipelines are governed by Groovy syntax.
5. What is the purpose of writing "agent any" at the beginning of a Declarative Pipeline?
6. Jenkins can run jobs on multiple servers, but to do this we must first add the other servers as agents via SSH and assign them labels. 
   Java must be installed on every agent server because Jenkins uses Java APIs to communicate. Without Java, the agent cannot function or 
   execute commands issued by the master.
7. Steps to add an agent:
   - Go to the .ssh folder on the master server.
   - Generate SSH keys and copy the public key.
   - Go to the .ssh folder on the agent server and add the public key to the authorized_keys file.
   - In Jenkins, go to Dashboard → Nodes → Add Node → choose SSH credentials → add the private key from the master and save.
   - The agent will remain offline until Java is installed. After installing Java, the agent will come online and the master can assign jobs to it.
8. There is a different method to assign agents for Freestyle jobs and a different method for Declarative Pipelines.
9. When setting up an agent, we assign an agent label. Multiple agents can share the same label.
10. Before running any job on an agent, ensure that the agent is online, Java is installed, Docker is installed, and the user has permission to run Docker without 
    sudo (by adding the user to the docker group and rebooting).
11. Create a Freestyle project to run the Django Todo-App on agent-1. During configuration, select the option to run the job on the connected agent.
12. Explain when to use Jenkins Freestyle jobs and when to use Jenkins Declarative Pipelines. Describe the use cases for both.
