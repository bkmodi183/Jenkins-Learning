2. Jnekins flow diagram that explained in the view.
3. what is jenkins jobs?
4. Difference between CI/CD(Continuos delivery) and CI/CD(Continuos Deployment)
5. Deliver a project todo-app via creating a Jenkins job. -> here we understand that why docker-compose is useful (docker-compuse down and then docker-compose up).
   Also in the project add the email id to get notification for every unstable build.
7. Likewise build a todo-application project based on CD (Continuous deployment).
